# Raku-LLVM
Raku bindings for the LLVM that go beyond the C API (like it uses raku stuff).

Make sure that you have LLVM 7 installed (for now at least).

Todo:
- Add more examples.
- Add helper constructs/functions (such as an if/else function for `Builder`s).
- Add documentation (might use POD6 or pages idk).
- Add (at least a few) tests.
