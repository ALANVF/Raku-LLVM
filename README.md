# Raku-LLVM
Raku bindings for the LLVM that go beyond the C API (like it uses raku stuff).

Once it's on CPAN, yo'll ned to make sure that you are using LLVM 7 (for now).

Todo:
- Add more examples.
- Add a META6.json so that I can add this to CPAN.
- Figure out why markdown preview on github looks weird.
