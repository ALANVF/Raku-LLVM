# Raku-LLVM
Raku bindings for the LLVM that go beyond the C API (like it uses raku stuff).

If you get some error saying that it can't read some file, then uh that wasn't supposed to happen (open an issue for it).

Make sure that you have LLVM 7 installed (for now at least).

Todo:
- Add more examples.
- Figure out why markdown preview on github looks weird.
